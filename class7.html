    //HOISTING\\ --->(for all let var and const) when something(all declarations but not initializations) is pushed/hoisted to the top

    //let and const are hoisted as well but you cannt access them before init. bcz these remain in temporal dead zone(place where variable is declared but not init)


    // console.log(x); //error

    // console.log(x); // error as x is not hoisted as no identifier is put before x in next line...here is will not be trated as var for the above console statement
    // x=10   // bcz it looks like an assignment not a declaration to JS

    // console.log(x); // undefined as variable x is not defined and hoisted to the top / start of the code so no error but undefined as in next line x is declared as var
    // var x    // it looks like a declaration to JS

    // console.log(x); // undefined
    // var x=5;
    // console.log(x); // 5

     
    //  console.log(x); // error (let cannt acces x before initi.. bcx x in next line is of let type)
    //  let x=5

    //  console.log(x); // error (const cannt acces x before initi.. bcx x in next line is of const type)
    //  const x=5
